BuildableGameLocation needed
	Checks to see if building is present so you can build there or not
	Need to check for custombuildings and buildings
	Can add custom building to the buildings as a "fake" building so that the 
	original buildings wont be placeable on custom buildings
	Dont do that step until after testing to see if you can in fact build default buildings on
	top of custom buildings

Add, move, demolish is the same, need to do twice, once for building list and once for custom building list
